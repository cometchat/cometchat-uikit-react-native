# CometChat UI Kit for React Native

The CometChat React Native UI Kit provides a pre-built user interface kit that developers can use to quickly integrate a reliable & fully-featured chat experience into an existing or a new app.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16
- npm >= 8
- React Native >= 0.63

## Getting Started
 To set up CometChat React Native UI Kit and utilize CometChat for your chat and calls functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Register at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) to create an account.
- After registering, log into your CometChat account and create a new app. Once created, CometChat will generate an Auth Key and App ID for you. Keep these credentials secure as you'll need them later.
- Check the [Key Concepts](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/react-native-uikit/key-concepts) to understand the basic components of CometChat.
- Refer to the [Integration Steps](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/react-native-uikit/integration) in our documentation to integrate the UI Kit into your React Native app.
